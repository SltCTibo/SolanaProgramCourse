# What Did I Learn

## Project 1 - Favorites Application

•	**Skills gained**: Basic Solana program architecture, interaction with Solana’s Program Derived Addresses (PDA), handling state on-chain.

•	**Key learning**: How to store and retrieve user preferences or data on-chain using Solana programs, and how to handle off-chain user interactions with on-chain programs.

## Project 2 - Voting App

•	**Skills gained**: Understanding how Solana programs handle input from multiple users, managing state transitions in a program.

•	**Learning**: Handling multi-user input and managing states in a decentralized voting system. This project helped you understand secure vote tallying and on-chain record management.

## Project 3 - Blinks and Actions

•	**Skills gained**: Event-driven programming in Solana, handling user actions, and response management.

•	**Learning**: Event-driven programming in Solana. You explored how user actions trigger specific on-chain behaviors and updates in real-time.

Extracted voting app code, created server-side component via nextjs, vies and test blink via dial.to

## Project 4 - Crud App

•	**Skills gained**: Implementing Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality on Solana, understanding persistent storage on-chain.

•	**Key learning**: Efficient data management in a decentralized system, and handling user-specific data in Solana.

## Project 5 - Create a Token

•	**Skills gained**: Token minting on Solana, understanding the SPL Token program.

•	**Key learning**: How to create, distribute, and manage tokens on the Solana network, gaining familiarity with Solana’s token standards and SPL Token creation.

## Project 6 - Create a NFT

•	**Skills gained**: Minting and managing non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Solana.

•	**Key learning**: How to create unique digital assets, attach metadata to NFTs, and interact with the Solana Metaplex standard for NFT minting and management.

## Project 7 - Swap Program

•	**Skills gained**: Building decentralized exchanges (DEX), working with token swaps and liquidity pools.

•	**Key learning**: How to facilitate token-to-token exchanges in a decentralized manner, and managing liquidity pools using the Solana blockchain.

## Project 8 - Token vesting dApp

•	**Skills gained**: Building token vesting schedules, understanding time-locked contracts.

•	**Key learning**: Creating contracts that release tokens over time, implementing token vesting logic, and ensuring the correct distribution of tokens based on time or event conditions.

Initialize vesting contract, give emplopyer ability to add employees, Allow employees to claim vested tokens

## Project 9 - Token Lottery

•	**Skills gained**: Creating decentralized lottery systems, ensuring fairness in random selection.

•	**Key learning**: Building a token-based lottery on Solana, understanding randomness in decentralized environments, and handling prize distributions via smart contracts.

Buy tickets from, Claim prizes using tickets, Use off-chain randomness to decide winner

## Project 10 - Lending Application

•	**Skills gained**: Creating decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platforms, understanding collateral and interest rates on-chain.

•	**Key learning**: How to implement a lending and borrowing system using Solana, securing collateralized loans, and managing interest rates or loan conditions on-chain.

Deposit, withdraw, borrow, repay, liquidate, setup accounts

## Project 11 - Programmable Money

•	**Skills gained**: Building a stablecoin on Solana, understanding smart contracts for currency management, and implementing financial primitives on-chain.
•	**Key learning**: How to create programmable money that operates within the Solana blockchain, ensuring stability through collateral management and automated on-chain logic.
