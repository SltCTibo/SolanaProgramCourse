# What Did I Learn

## Project 1 - Favorites Application

•	**Skills gained**: Basic Solana program architecture, interaction with Solana’s Program Derived Addresses (PDA), handling state on-chain.

•	**Key learning**: How to store and retrieve user preferences or data on-chain using Solana programs, and how to handle off-chain user interactions with on-chain programs.

## Project 2 - Voting App

•	**Skills gained**: Understanding how Solana programs handle input from multiple users, managing state transitions in a program.

•	**Learning**: Handling multi-user input and managing states in a decentralized voting system. This project helped you understand secure vote tallying and on-chain record management.

## Project 3 - Blinks and Actions

•	**Skills gained**: Event-driven programming in Solana, handling user actions, and response management.

•	**Learning**: Event-driven programming in Solana. You explored how user actions trigger specific on-chain behaviors and updates in real-time.

## Project 4 - Crud App

•	**Skills gained**: Implementing Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality on Solana, understanding persistent storage on-chain.

•	**Key learning**: Efficient data management in a decentralized system, and handling user-specific data in Solana.

## Project 5 - Create a Token

•	**Skills gained**: Token minting on Solana, understanding the SPL Token program.

•	**Key learning**: How to create, distribute, and manage tokens on the Solana network, gaining familiarity with Solana’s token standards and SPL Token creation.

## Project 6 - Create a NFT

•	**Skills gained**: Minting and managing non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Solana.

•	**Key learning**: How to create unique digital assets, attach metadata to NFTs, and interact with the Solana Metaplex standard for NFT minting and management.

## Project 7 - Swap Program

•	**Skills gained**: Building decentralized exchanges (DEX), working with token swaps and liquidity pools.

•	**Key learning**: How to facilitate token-to-token exchanges in a decentralized manner, and managing liquidity pools using the Solana blockchain.

## Project 8 - Token vesting dApp

•	**Skills gained**: Building token vesting schedules, understanding time-locked contracts.

•	**Key learning**: Creating contracts that release tokens over time, implementing token vesting logic, and ensuring the correct distribution of tokens based on time or event conditions.

## Project 9 - Token Lottery

•	**Skills gained**: Creating decentralized lottery systems, ensuring fairness in random selection.

•	**Key learning**: Building a token-based lottery on Solana, understanding randomness in decentralized environments, and handling prize distributions via smart contracts.
